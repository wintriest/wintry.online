                                <p>The time is.. eleven fifty-one…</p>
                                <p>What do I even do to burn time..?</p>
                                <p>It’d be better if I could leave with Hayashi right away..</p>
                                <p>…</p>
                                <p>One thirty-three…</p>
                                <p>Why is my watch ticking so slow..?</p>
                                <p>..And here I thought he’d be excited… but he’s just sleeping..</p>
                                <p>Should I just sleep too…?</p>
                                <p>…</p>
                                <p>Four forty-nine.. sleeping really does help… but can’t this go any faster?</p>
                                <p>..Hayashi on the other hand was already awake… Though I kept my head buried in my arms, I turned to look at him—he’s just..</p>
                                <p>“Look at the board, not me.”</p>
                                <p>“...” I didn’t utter a response, but I didn’t look at the board either.</p>
                                <p>“You’re that excited?”</p>
                                <p>“Me?” I asked, and he just stared at me. “..Why would I be?”</p>
                                <p>I scratched my head in annoyance, asking such stupid questions..</p>
                                <p>…</p>
                                <p>Then finally… classes came to a halt. I glanced at Hayashi, watching if he’d stand and leave right away. He noticed me eyeing him, and once he stood—I immediately followed suit; I could almost bolt out the school in excitement.</p>
                                <p>After we tediously swapped our indoor shoes with the outside pair—stepping outside… it felt like the air got chiller.</p>
                                <p>It’s exciting.. winter.</p>
                                <p>“Isn’t it exciting?” he asked.</p>
                                <p>“..What does?”</p>
                                <p>“Winter.”</p>
                                <p>“...You—read my mind.”</p>
                                <p>“Oh, you were thinking the same thing?”</p>
                                <p>“..Do you like it?” I asked.</p>
                                <p>“I do.” he said as I stared at the pale sky. “During winter, it just feels like the world’s slower. I can take my time and just relax.”</p>
                                <p class="disruption">Ngh… ever since we stepped out, my head’s been hurting; everything feels fragmented..</p>
                                <p>“Yeah, I agree—it just feels ethereal.” I slowly responded.</p>
                                <p>I can’t hear Hayashi properly.</p>
                                <p>This feeling… it’s almost like when..</p>
                                <p>“<span class="ds-ren">Aihara-san…</span>” this unpleasant voice ringing in my head… <span class="s-ren">Sakuragi</span>.. “<span class="ds-ren">What’s this supposed to be?</span>” he muttered, tone ringing with mockery. I suddenly felt myself being pulled towards him—the headache once mild… began to feel like needles being driven deeper down my brain..</p>
                                <p>“What do you think you’re doing?” a sudden voice of clarity—setting a halt to the torment in my head… Hayashi..?</p>
                                <p>His voice.. different.</p>
                                <p>He brushed <span class="s-ren">Sakuragi</span> aside as if swatting away a leaf.</p>
                                <p>Gently—he grabbed my wrist and pulled me away from <span class="s-ren">Sakuragi</span>.</p>
                                <p>“Hayashi..” I called.</p>
                                <p>When I finally noticed, I was behind him. The headache weakened—my vision clearer, and the constant ringing noise in my head somewhat subsided.. though it’s still there.</p>
                                <p>Why are they… just staring at each other..?</p>
                                <p>“<span class="ds-ren">Here I thought you sounded familiar</span>…” <span class="s-ren">Sakuragi</span> laughed, piercing my ears. “<span class="ds-ren">What’s our soccer genius doing here?</span>”</p>
                                <p>..Soccer genius..?</p>
                                <p>“<span class="ds-ren">I thought I made it clear to everyone that Aihara’s mine?</span>” <span class="s-ren">Sakuragi</span> claimed, yet I couldn’t respond back.</p>
                                <p>I may have felt strange… my head may have been buzzing with pain—but there was something far more different.</p>
                                <p>..Hayashi.</p>
                                <p>“What’s with this wannabe protagonist of a third-rate sports manga doing here?” he retaliated with a cold voice. “I thought I was done with your petty tantrums.”</p>
                                <p class="disruption">I reflexively took a step back because all of a sudden.. my headache worsened as <span class="s-ren">Sakuragi</span>’s fist flew towards Hayashi—but it never connected.</p>
                                <p>Hayashi had already caught it with surgical precision, his posture remained perfectly still… he didn’t even move his feet..</p>
                                <p>“Aihara… to think you had to tolerate this clown.”</p>
                                <p>“<span class="ds-ren">What’d you call me?!</span>”</p>
                                <p>“A bottom-feeder blaming his mediocrity on me… two times now.”</p>
                                <p>Instantly after speaking, Hayashi moved again.. efficiently.</p>
                                <p>He immediately pinned <span class="s-ren">Sakuragi</span> to the pavement beneath his knee..</p>
                                <p>So… effortless..</p>
                                <p>“For too long I’ve held back from your antics. I won’t refrain from destroying your career if you pull off a stunt like this again.” Hayashi stated.</p>
                                <p>..Did they have… history..?</p>
                                <p class="disruption">…For a moment I stood there, unaware of the words being exchanged as the conflict finally settled. From the constant buzz that rang my head earlier, the world was suddenly too silent—I couldn’t move.</p>
                                <p>I felt… <b>disconnected.</b></p>
                                <p>I couldn’t move a muscle.</p>
                                <p>Until someone held my arms that I snapped back into place.</p>
                                <p><b>I could hear again.</b></p>
                                <p><b>I could see again.</b></p>
                                <p><b>Hayashi</b>—holding my arms, having shaken me.</p>
                                <p>“What happened? Are you alright..?” he asked, his hand leaving my arm and placed upon my forehead, pressing against my neck.</p>
                                <p>“..I’m fine…” I muttered. “What happened?”</p>
                                <p>“I made him leave, I already told him off.”</p>
                                <p>“I see..”</p>
                                <p>“You’re disoriented aren’t you..?” he asked, so spot on…</p>
                                <p>Do I tell him..?</p>
                                <p>“Hold onto me—I’ll escort you to your dorm.” he extended his arm towards me..</p>
                                <p>“No..” I shook my head. “We’re going on a date..”</p>
                                <p>“..You sure?”</p>
                                <p>“..Yeah.” Though it took some time to convince him that I was fine, he finally began to lead the way. “...May I?”</p>
                                <p>He looked at me wondering what I was asking for.</p>
                                <p>I extended my hand, reaching towards him.</p>
                                <p>There I held onto his wrist.</p>
                                <p>For.. stability.</p>
