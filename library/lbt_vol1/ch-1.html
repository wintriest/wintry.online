                                <h2><b>An Unusual Letter</b></h2>
                                <p>It’s October again, welcoming me with open arms. The harsh heat of the sun has begun to dwindle, and the world’s slowly shifting to another season.</p>
                                <p>The days have been a bit too long; the weather’s growing even colder. And this class’ forever frozen—unable to open up this cold heart of mine. It has been months, the school calendar’s at its second term—yet here I am with no one by my side..</p>
                                <p>Am I truly incapable of establishing connections..?</p>
                                <p>Regardless of how much I long for a proper acquaintance..</p>
                                <p>It can’t manifest here.</p>
                                <p>I put all my guards up when I was pestered initially—now here I am.. ignored and alone, longing to be pestered.</p>
                                <p>Though there is something that continues to bother me..</p>
                                <p>It was a few weeks ago, I arrived at school way too early. The hallways were desolate, and the chirping birds were nigh.</p>
                                <p>I sat on my seat pondering on what to do with my leftover free time. There I recalled the novel I left under my desk, so I reached for it; but as I pulled it out, something else came with it—a white envelope… A letter? Like flashbacks to my first week at this school, those love letters popped a nerve. Here I thought they’d already given up. Thus… I stood from my seat, crumpling the letter and tossing it straight to the bins.</p>
                                <p>After that day, another letter appeared in my shoe locker. That letter received the same fate as the previous one. But a few days later, I got home from school—and right after I took a bath..</p>
                                <p>I saw a letter on my study desk…</p>
                                <p>In my room.</p>
                                <p>In my.. dorm room..?</p>
                                <p>I always lock the door.. don’t I? So how-</p>
                                <p>“Take out your book and go to page 76. Answer that for half an hour, that’s more than enough so no excuses.” announced by the teacher dragging me back—followed by the yawning complaints of my classmates.</p>
                                <p>“Isn’t this too much??” one questioned in disbelief.</p>
                                <p>“No it isn't, you'll finish it if you keep your mouth shut.”</p>
                                <p>No longer in a trance, I opened the book to said page… And what awaited me was not <i>questions</i>, but a letter.</p>
                                <p>How?</p>
                                <p>I mean—<i>exactly</i> at this page..?</p>
                                <p>Who is it?</p>
                                <p>How are they doing it? It’s almost as if…</p>
                                <p><i>Ugh…</i> I can’t get my head around it..</p>
                                <p>I just watched the white envelope laid neatly on the page.. and kept staring at it for a moment longer.</p>
                                <p><i>How frustrating…</i></p>
                                <p>The way these letters mysteriously end up in my path—it’s making me question my sanity… Like.. how is it even showing up like this? What is it that must be said that they persistently keep appearing..? How is the person behind this… putting these letters in such places?</p>
                                <p>Isn’t it just a stalker at this point? I don’t understand how that one letter even got in my dorm..</p>
                                <p>I’m going crazy.</p>
                                <p>...</p>
                                <p>Must I.. <i>really</i> read these letters..?</p>
                                <p>Maybe… <i>just</i> maybe I’ll understand?</p>
                                <p>Then… Almost as though it was Pandora’s box..</p>
                                <p>With a bit of hesitation—I ripped the letter open.</p>

                                    <div class="text-bar">

                                        <p class="subject">Mizuki, my dearest.</p>
                                        <p>This is the fourth letter that I’ve written.</p>
                                        <p>Don’t fret if the numbers don’t match as I’m unsure if you have read the past letters nor have you come to believe the words I’ve said.</p>
                                        <p>But if this somehow reaches you, do believe that I see no other than you to be the one.</p>
                                        <p>From what we’ve gone through in the future, I assure you that the journey we’ll go through is that of beauty and fulfillment.</p>
                                        <p>I’ve already begun this journey with you, I hope for nothing but to end this journey with you as well.</p>
                                        <p class="signed">-your future lover.</p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <p>..My—future lover..?</p>
                                <p>Our… journey? What even is..?</p>
                                <p>Is this real? Is there someone pulling a prank on me? Just who could be..? Wait—why am I believing this? A letter from the future? No way that’s real… But.. I don’t think anybody in this school has developed some sort of interest in me… Perhaps I’m being made fun of? Is this what I get for being such a loner?</p>
                                <p>What the hell did I get myself into…?</p>
                                <p>…Fourth letter.. yeah… This is the fourth one I’ve come across..</p>
                                <p>My eyes couldn’t help but keep scanning the letter, retracing each word in an attempt to comprehend such an unbelievable story…</p>
                                <p>I don’t really want to believe this.. future lover…</p>
                                <p>I may become a laughing stock if this is indeed a prank.</p>
                                <p>Anything but that..</p>
                                <p>Once again, snapping me out of my spiraling thoughts. The teacher tapped the board. “Five minutes left.” It seems as though time has ticked too much as I questioned myself.</p>
                                <p>Have I really been frozen here for that long..?</p>
                                <p>Stuffing the letter aside, I finally saw what they were complaining about. It wasn’t just page 76, it extended to the back. There were five essays—with too much space between each question.. a silent indicator for longer answers…</p>
                                <p>This must be the consequence, that letter’s the embodiment of Pandora’s box.. I should’ve never opened it in the first place.</p>
                                <p>Unsure of what to do.. I glanced to my right, there sat Hayashi, his pen swaying left and right.. Almost at the end of the second page. “Perhaps it’s better if you glanced at your own paper and actually answered?” he suddenly spoke.</p>
                                <p>“..R-right.” I muttered as a shiver ran down my spine, this must be the first time we’ve spoken..</p>
                                <p>“What have you been doing to have a page so clean?”</p>
                                <p>“I…” My voice stammered, unable to come up with a response. “..Mind your own business.” I mumbled in a low annoyed voice.</p>
                                <p>“Well, I’m cheering you on.” he blandly said.</p>
                                <p>I shot another glance at his paper. It was filled to the brim. While mine sat collecting dust instead of answers… Here I thought this guy was an introvert for the months we’ve been seatmates.</p>
                                <p>But he’s just..</p>
                                <p>Really annoying…</p>
