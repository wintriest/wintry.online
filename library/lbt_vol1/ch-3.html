                                <h2><b>Profound Similarities</b></h2>
                                <p>No longer gold… the world’s saturation is really dropping—I let out a heavy sigh as I’m enveloped in an unexpected chill. Each step forward growing tremendously difficult as the mood is perfect for snuggling in bed, yet here I am going to school.</p>
                                <p>Today’s rather quiet..</p>
                                <p>The leaves I step on are crunchy.</p>
                                <p>The birds are chirping lightly..</p>
                                <p>Even the students around me are chatting softly…</p>
                                <p>Hah… even if I can’t skip school—today’s a comfortable day.</p>
                                <p>I passed through the school gates, and there I saw him afar.</p>
                                <p>As much as I wanted to forget that name… there’s no deleting it.</p>
                                <p class="s-ren">Sakuragi Ren.</p>
                                <p>Ever since then, his narcissistic attitude has grown stagnant. He still persists in greeting me and inviting me out, but I mirror his persistence by giving him no attention. Yet it worries me because there’s this buzzing in my head whenever he’s around, a constant headache whenever he’s in proximity.</p>
                                <p>Though it’s quite surprising—today I see him with his arms around the shoulders of another girl.</p>
                                <p>I guess.. 18 days was all it took to get him discouraged.</p>
                                <p>Continuing forward, I lowered my head as I passed through the busy students. Taking my time as I swapped my outdoor shoes with the indoor pair.</p>
                                <p>Once done, I stepped inside the building and noticed a familiar figure.</p>
                                <p>“...”</p>
                                <p>“Oi ocha.” I said, my favorite green tea.</p>
                                <p>“Are you really not giving me any slack..?”</p>
                                <p>“No.” I folded my arms and gave him a questionable look. “Backing out on your words? I can’t have that.”</p>
                                <p>“You’re paying for tomorrow.” he said, turning his back on me—walking towards a vending machine in the corner.</p>
                                <p>“Me? Who are you talking about?” I scoffed.</p>
                                <p>“I have a recording of what you said.”</p>
                                <p>“I said nothing.” I stood behind him as he pressed a few buttons on the machine and squatted down to pick them up. Then there it was, handing it to me, my green tea. “Thank you, really. Even though I never asked for it, you knew.”</p>
                                <p>“I’m also thankful—for what you’ll spend for me tomorrow..”</p>
                                <p>“..I won’t pay for something absurdly expensive.” I said as we began walking through the hallway.</p>
                                <p>“Don’t fret, I won’t do that.”</p>
                                <p>…</p>
                                <p>There it is.</p>
                                <p>It was just… two words—but still..</p>
                                <p>I keep seeing it in so many of the letters. Too many have come—not much point in counting them; though I do keep them all in my room.</p>
                                <p>From most of it, one phrase keeps standing out.</p>
                                <p>I see it in the letters.</p>
                                <p>I hear it from him.</p>
                                <p><b>Don’t fret.</b></p>
                                <p>…</p>
                                <p>I have no idea what to make of this.</p>
                                <p>Though it undeniably makes him… a candidate.</p>
                                <p>For my…</p>
                                <p>It’s embarrassing to even say this…</p>
                                <p>But he <i>might</i> be my future lover.</p>
                                <p>“What’s wrong with you?” he suddenly asked.</p>
                                <p>I glance to my right and there he was, drinking the apple juice he got from the vending machine earlier. “...What do you mean?”</p>
                                <p>“You’ve been blank.”</p>
                                <p>“..Hah?”</p>
                                <p>“You must’ve skipped breakfast, you’re always dozing off.” he said, turning his attention from me.</p>
                                <p>“Aihara-san.” a feminine voice called.</p>
                                <p>It was—Kujou-san.</p>
                                <p>“What is it?”</p>
                                <p>“They said you had the class funds?” she asked, a bit confused.</p>
                                <p>“Why would I have it?”</p>
                                <p>“They told me you had it.” she said, pointing at a group of girls up front.</p>
                                <p>“I don’t have it.” I shook my head before letting out a sigh as she left my desk.</p>
                                <p>“..What was that about…” I muttered as I reached under my desk, looking for my novel—but… “Kujou-san.” I stood, the sound of my chair scraping against the wood floor—reverberated across the classroom.</p>
                                <p>My voice came with it, garnering everyone’s attention as Kujou-san herself stopped in her tracks, turning to look at me, awaiting my response.</p>
                                <p>From under my desk… was an envelope full of cash.</p>
                                <p>“I found it.” I said, pulling it out from the storage of my desk.</p>
                                <p>“Didn’t she say she <i>didn’t</i> have it?” someone murmured.</p>
                                <p>“So… she stole it?” they laughed.</p>
                                <p>This absurdity.. again.</p>
                                <p>As it would’ve been awkward walking through everyone to reach Kujou-san, she saved me the trouble as she walked over to me and reached for the envelope. “Thank you, Aihara-san.” she slightly bowed after I handed it to her.</p>
                                <p>I sat down—brows now furrowed as I folded my arms. They’re doing something again… here I thought they were already tired of me..</p>
                                <p>“We came here together didn’t we?” Hayashi suddenly asked.</p>
                                <p>“..Yes, why?”</p>
                                <p>“Someone must’ve put that there, don’t mind it.” he said.</p>
                                <p>He didn’t say the line…</p>
                                <p>“Yeah, I know.” I looked down, unsure of how to act.</p>
                                <p>Though he kept looking at me, I didn’t want to talk any longer.. In search of what I could do, I remembered the novel I was reaching for earlier.</p>
                                <p>Once I began searching for it under my desk—I hoped not to find anything else that wasn’t mine…</p>
                                <p>Thankfully enough, their play had ended with the class funds—there was nothing else. I kept an eye on the girls that may have done it… but they were busy being loud amongst themselves.. Perhaps I don’t need to worry anymore..?</p>
                                <p>I turned to look at Hayashi—now minding his own business, and we didn’t really have anything to talk about; so I finally opened the novel to continue reading.</p>
                                <p>Flipping from one page to another, I kept back tracking.. some lines failing to register in my head, my mind… still preoccupied.</p>
                                <p>..So I just put the book down.</p>
                                <p>With nothing else to do, I lifted my arms to my desk—and simply buried my head in it.</p>
                                <p>For a while, the noise around me was drowned out by my thoughts.</p>
                                <p>I thought that if I just stayed like this for a moment… everything will pass.. I’d no longer be worrying over.. nothing.</p>
                                <p>…</p>
                                <p>Like being pulled back, I felt someone tap my shoulder. I lifted my head up, then turned to its direction. Hayashi.. he did some strange actions—signalling me something… my face..? I immediately looked at the window, taking a look at my reflection.</p>
                                <p>..My hair’s all messed up.</p>
                                <p>I took my time fixing myself and slowly turned to look at him.</p>
                                <p>“You slept through the entire morning class.”</p>
                                <p>“..I did?” I asked, unsure of what to make of it.</p>
                                <p>“Yeah, I told the teachers you weren’t feeling well.”</p>
                                <p>“...” I stared. “..You didn’t have to do that.” I muttered.</p>
                                <p>“You’re still worried about earlier?”</p>
                                <p>“So..?”</p>
                                <p>“I know what will make you feel better.”</p>
                                <p>“..What’s this about?”</p>
                                <p>“Let’s grab coffee after school.” he suddenly proposed.</p>
                                <p>“...” I stared at him, intensely. I narrowed my eyes—wondering what he meant by it. “I can’t believe you’re asking me out on a date, Hayashi.”</p>
                                <p>“Ah, then nevermind.” he folded his arms and looked the other way.</p>
                                <p>“I didn’t say no.” I stated, avoiding eye contact.</p>
                                <p>“Then-”</p>
                                <p>“Your treat… I assume?” I asked—now looking at him in the eye.</p>
                                <p>“Yeah, I’m the one who suggested it.”</p>
                                <p>“Then.. okay.”</p>
