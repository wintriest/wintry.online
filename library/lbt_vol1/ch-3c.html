                                <p>It’s quiet… too quiet..</p>
                                <p>I held onto what was within my grasp—it’s… rough.. warm even…</p>
                                <p>Initially loud, the noise of the world came back all at once.</p>
                                <p>..Then settled.</p>
                                <p>I kept holding onto it.</p>
                                <p>...Till I felt it hold back.</p>
                                <p>Though heavy… I tried to open my eyes.</p>
                                <p>The darkness of the room made it somewhat easier..</p>
                                <p>..In due time, I let out a sigh.</p>
                                <p>I turned my head around—it’s my room..</p>
                                <p>What.. time is it..?</p>
                                <p>“Aihara.” I heard.</p>
                                <p>“..Hayashi?” I called.</p>
                                <p>I turned to look at him, he was still there.</p>
                                <p>…I slowly looked down.</p>
                                <p>He’s still sitting on my bed.</p>
                                <p>I’m now.. holding his hand..</p>
                                <p>“You… didn’t leave..?” I asked.</p>
                                <p>“I couldn’t leave you like this.”</p>
                                <p>..I’m glad… he stayed..</p>
                                <p>For a moment, I kept holding onto him—not wanting to let go at all. I wanted to get up and sit next to him—but I couldn’t…</p>
                                <p>With one audible exhale, I turned to Hayashi.</p>
                                <p>“..Can you help me up?” I muttered, unsure if he could hear.</p>
                                <p>He let go of my hand and gently pulled me up; finally letting me sit upright—guiding me to rest my back against the wall.</p>
                                <p>“..Thank you.” I muttered, staring at him as he remained seated before me.</p>
                                <p>Has he really been sitting here the whole time..?</p>
                                <p>“Aihara.” he called—I tilted my head, wondering what he intended to ask. “Is there anything you need?”</p>
                                <p>“..No—not really.” I spoke, slowly.</p>
                                <p>Then I sat in silence again, just taking my time as I breathe.</p>
                                <p>“..Aihara.” he called… again..?</p>
                                <p>“What..?”</p>
                                <p>“Should I not have fought with him?” he suddenly asked. “I’ve been thinking, perhaps you got overwhelmed by my actions.”</p>
                                <p>I immediately shook my head, slightly disorienting me from the sudden movement.</p>
                                <p>“No… far from it..” I said as I observed his concerned expression. “I’m grateful—for what you did; you saved me.”</p>
                                <p>“..I see.”</p>
                                <p>I leaned my head backwards, letting out another heavy sigh.</p>
                                <p>Softly… I bit my lips, making sure I was awake..</p>
                                <p>“..Hayashi.” I called.</p>
                                <p>He looked at me in the eyes—non-verbally letting me proceed.</p>
                                <p>“Can you sit next to me..?” I patted down the space beside me on the bed. “I don’t want you leaving yet..”</p>
                                <p>He remained silent—processing my request then carefully sat next to me.. though with a bit of distance.</p>
                                <p>I squeezed my hands and scooted closer—till our shoulders pressed against each other.</p>
                                <p>..Just like this.</p>
                                <p>“May I… explain?” I asked—and he nodded.</p>
                                <p>I turned my head to look at him, he was just there.</p>
                                <p>..After one last exhale, I recalled what had happened.</p>
                                <p>“I think I mentioned this to you before—the thing with Sakuragi constantly asking me out..?”</p>
                                <p>“Yeah, I remember.”</p>
                                <p>“I was able to deal with his persistence for a while… but it gradually became worse.” I said, unsure of how to phrase my words. “I’m not sure what happened to me… or what happened to him but.. there began this… <i>buzzing noise</i> in my head..?” I explained, confusing even myself.</p>
                                <p>“A buzzing noise..?”</p>
                                <p>“Yeah.. in my head—whenever he was nearby.”</p>
                                <p>I turned to look at him again, wondering how he’d react to the absurd things coming out of my mouth.</p>
                                <p>“Then… what happened when he pulled you earlier?”</p>
                                <p>“..I… didn’t even notice until the pain just… got really painful.. Like—needles in my brain.. does that make sense..?”</p>
                                <p>“Kind of… then what about earlier?” he asked.</p>
                                <p>“..Earlier?”</p>
                                <p>“You froze.”</p>
                                <p>…Should I tell him..?</p>
                                <p>Unlike the headache I got from <span class="s-ren">Sakuragi</span>.. that one was entirely different… I don’t think he’d believe that I… disconnected.. or something.</p>
                                <p>“I… don’t know.” I muttered, choosing to keep it from him. “But you holding me.. it really helped… perhaps I was just overwhelmed..”</p>
                                <p>“..By me?”</p>
                                <p>“No… the headache.”</p>
                                <p>He still thinks it’s partly his fault..</p>
                                <p>Though I do admit… I wasn’t expecting him to be able to do that.</p>
                                <p>In that moment, I definitely witnessed a side of him he never showed. But.. it wasn’t overwhelming. In that moment… he remained calm..</p>
                                <p>..I’m really glad he was there.</p>
                                <p>“..Aihara?” he asked.</p>
                                <p>I stared at him, briefly holding eye contact.</p>
                                <p>“What is it?”</p>
                                <p>“How’s your status?”</p>
                                <p>My.. status..?</p>
                                <p>“..I’m fine now… I just need a little rest.” I exhaled and looked at him again. “..Aren’t you getting tired of calling me Aihara?”</p>
                                <p>“What else am I supposed to call you with..?”</p>
                                <p>“..Mizuki.” I said. “Mizuki’s fine.”</p>
                                <p>“Mizuki.” he suddenly called.</p>
                                <p>“...What?” I asked, but he didn’t say anything. I waited for a moment longer, but that was all he said. “..You’re so weird.”</p>
                                <p>“How?”</p>
                                <p>“I gave you permission—but why did you say it for no reason?” I asked—internally comparing this side of him to the one earlier.</p>
                                <p>“I was just practicing, I’ve never called anyone by their first name.”</p>
                                <p>“You’re a weirdo..”</p>
                                <p>“Am I?”</p>
                                <p>“You are.” I said, fondly watching him as he remained by my side.</p>
                                <p>..Having him by my side—feeling that he’s indeed there as his shoulder is against me… it really helps.</p>
                                <p>It really scares me, like… what would’ve happened if he wasn’t there..?</p>
                                <p>Kousei..</p>
                                <p>From the start, I couldn’t even understand what was happening—yet I could feel the pain getting worse and worse. So I wonder… how much longer would I have been stuck in that state if it wasn’t for him..?</p>
                                <p>That moment of.. disconnection…</p>
                                <p>It won’t happen again, won’t it?</p>
                                <p>“...Kousei.” I called, and he turned to look at me. “Is it alright if I ask?”</p>
                                <p>“About him?” he asked, confirming—and I nodded. “We played in the same club; a soccer club in junior high, we were winning tournaments—made it through regionals, even reached provincials.” he explained.</p>
                                <p>There I remembered Sakuragi’s words, calling Kousei a soccer genius.</p>
                                <p>“For a while, we were just teammates. Sakuragi was the team’s center forward; the player in position to score goals—I was an offensive midfielder; the player who sets up attack positions and passes to whomever can conjure a goal.”</p>
                                <p>“..Was he good?”</p>
                                <p>“He was alright, he was right where I needed him most of the time. Though things turned sour when I left the team before the nationals.”</p>
                                <p>“You left..?”</p>
                                <p>“Yeah, I got fed up.” he sighed. “He always boasted about his goal count, fuming in anger when I shoot instead of passing; claiming all the glory and disregarding his teammates—going further to belittle other club members and stirring drama in the team.”</p>
                                <p>“..To think something like that happened… is that why you left?”</p>
                                <p>“Well, I wouldn’t have cared about the troubles he had caused. But I was always the one having to manage his outburst—it felt more like babysitting.”</p>
                                <p>“..I see…”</p>
                                <p>I looked at him—his eyes.</p>
                                <p>“Are you still playing?”</p>
                                <p>“Not really, I didn’t feel like joining a club.”</p>
                                <p>“Not even casually?”</p>
                                <p>“There’s nowhere to play at.” he said and I scratched my head.</p>
                                <p>“..I’m a bit curious to see how you’d play.”</p>
                                <p>“I’m terrible, don’t expect anything.”</p>
                                <p>“I’m expecting a lot.” I whispered, holding back a giggle.</p>
                                <p>..For a while we remained seated, leaving me to notice even the smallest of things. “Your hand is really small.” he said, unexpectedly.</p>
                                <p>“My hand..?” I repeated, lifting my hand and spreading my fingers apart—it seemed fine to me?</p>
                                <p>Then he showed me his hand.</p>
                                <p>..My hands are indeed small.</p>
                                <p>“Is there a problem with it?” I eyed him suspiciously.</p>
                                <p>“No, not really—it was just my first time holding someone’s hands.”</p>
                                <p>“Don’t say it. That word’s banned.” I silenced him, pushing my palm against his face.</p>
                                <p>“Are you that embarrassed?”</p>
                                <p>“..About what?”</p>
                                <p>“That you asked me to hold your hand.”</p>
                                <p>“Hah..? What are you talking about? I can’t hear you.”</p>
                                <p>“Mizuki—you asked me to hold your hand.” he repeated.</p>
                                <p>This guy really…</p>
                                <p>“You’re banned too..” I muttered before moving away from him. Though I struggled to get off the bed after so long, I managed to stand by myself.</p>
                                <p>I glanced at my watch on the table.. and it was eleven o’clock… Did this guy really stay at the girls’ dorms until this hour?</p>
                                <p>“Kousei, you know guys aren’t allowed here since like—2 hours ago..?”</p>
                                <p>“..Is that so?”</p>
                                <p>“It’ll be troublesome if they see you leaving my room and have a misunderstanding..” I scratched my head, wondering how I’d get this guy out of the building. “You should’ve just left when you dropped me here..”</p>
                                <p>“Like I said–” he spoke, about to say something forbidden again.</p>
                                <p>“Ah- ah– don’t even say it.”</p>
                                <p>..But I guess it’s true…</p>
                                <p>“..Kousei—we didn’t manage to get coffee earlier, right?” I mentioned.</p>
                                <p>“Don’t fret, we can go anytime you’re feeling well.”</p>
                                <p>..That phrase again…</p>
                                <p>“Why… don’t we walk outside..? Stop by a vending machine or something.” I suggested.</p>
                                <p>“At this hour?”</p>
                                <p>“Yeah, so I can leave the building with you too. It’d be bad to have you leave alone.” I explained, watching him think about it. Then after a bit—he got off my bed and just looked down at me.</p>
                                <p>“You’re not getting a sweater?”</p>
                                <p>“I don’t need it.”</p>
                                <p>“Just in case?”</p>
                                <p>I lightly stormed off towards the closet, picking a soft beige sweater I could comfortably hold onto. “..You satisfied?” I asked and he just nodded.</p>
                                <p>Turning the lights off my room, we stepped onto the hallway and walked side by side, taking small steps—not wanting to make noise and be discovered..</p>
                                <p>It was really dangerous for him to be here, one small mistake and he’d get punished severely. I still remember what happened back during the first semester—when a girl brought her boyfriend to the building…</p>
                                <p>“Mizuki.” he called as he opened the door to the outside and the breeze suddenly hit me.</p>
                                <p>..Was it this cold earlier..?</p>
                                <p>He looked at me with an amused expression—too amused; was he… making fun of me..? I stared back in dismay as I wore the sweater he told me to bring. “I told you.” he remarked.</p>
                                <p>“It just so happened that I’m feeling cold.. that’s all.”</p>
                                <p>I let out a sigh of relief, finally safe from potential trouble..</p>
                                <p>As we walked, I kept staring at the sky—though it was too dark to even see anything. But with this weather.. winter’s really close… perhaps in November the snow will fall..</p>
                                <p>…</p>
                                <p>..Kousei has moments where he’s annoying—but I can’t deny how much I’ve relied on him.</p>
                                <p>For many weeks we’ve been taking turns treating each other on the vending machine, but it was always me getting the better end of the stick.</p>
                                <p>I looked at him, his expression calm as he walked by my side.</p>
                                <p>Compared to earlier.. he wasn’t speaking much..</p>
                                <p>Well… <b>we</b> weren’t speaking much.</p>
                                <p>It seemed as though we ran out of things to say.</p>
                                <p>In the midst of a time when the world’s darker than ever, the vending machine stood out—glowing ethereal under the street spotlight</p>
                                <p>Immediately… I quickened my pace, extremely eager to get close.</p>
                                <p>Once I stood before the vending machine, he was still walking.</p>
                                <p>So many options…</p>
                                <p>“I kind of want coffee but…” I muttered—scratching my cheek.</p>
                                <p>“You won’t be able to sleep.”</p>
                                <p>“Exactly..” I scratched my head. “Oh.” I exclaimed, finally knowing what to get. Although… it wasn’t typically sold in vending machines..</p>
                                <p>“What is it?” he asked.</p>
                                <p>“..Hot cocoa.”</p>
                                <p>“..Hm, there’s a convenience store close by.” he said, pointing in a different direction of the street. “FamilyMart.”</p>
                                <p>Of course, I immediately agreed and we walked side by side again.</p>
                                <p>“I’m really using up your time today aren’t I?”</p>
                                <p>“It’s no problem really.. it isn’t always that I get to go outside like this.” he said, looking at the dark sky before glancing at me. “It’s a nice change of pace.”</p>
                                <p>“I see..” I muttered, watching him as we continued walking.</p>
                                <p>It wasn’t actually that close, but it wasn’t too far either.</p>
                                <p>We entered the store and he immediately made me sit as he walked through the aisles.. why’d he leave me here alone..? I wanted to look for some things too.</p>
                                <p>I settled in my seat, hugging myself as I let out a breath.</p>
                                <p>..It’s the first time I’ve spoken this much in a single day.</p>
                                <p>…</p>
                                <p>My gaze seemingly landed upon Kousei as he picked up some stuff in the store, and pressed some buttons on the machine for the hot cocoa…</p>
                                <p>..To think I’d one day experience something like this..</p>
                                <p>…I’m really thankful, Kousei..</p>
                                <p>Have I.. finally moved forward..?</p>
                                <p>..Or was it all due to the letters?</p>
                                <p>“Here.” Kousei’s voice brought me back.</p>
                                <p>I lightly stared at him as he placed the hot cocoa in front of me, along with some bread..</p>
                                <p>..Would this.. ever happen without the letters..?</p>
                                <p>“..Thank you.” I muttered. Though I just sat there, he suddenly reached over—pressing the back of his hand against my forehead, against my neck. “W-what is it..?” I stuttered in confusion.</p>
                                <p>“You were blanking off again, are you feeling well?”</p>
                                <p>“Oh.. yes… I’m feeling well.”</p>
                                <p>I held onto the hot paper cup with both of my hands.</p>
                                <p>It’s warm…</p>
                                <p>“What did you get?” I asked.</p>
                                <p>“It’s barley tea.”</p>
                                <p>We spent our time in silence—taking small bites off my bread. Taking our time as we waited for this long day to end.</p>
                                <p>“Thank you again… Kousei.”</p>
                                <p>“Don’t fret too much, anyone would’ve done the same.”</p>
                                <p>“No, it’s only you who’d do what you did.” I shook my head and looked outside the store. “Thank you.”</p>
