                                <h2><b>A Bent Image</b></h2>
                                <p>The pale sunlight crept its way through the curtains, softening the morning mood as I awoke in this bland world. Finally.. it seems like winter’s coming…</p>
                                <p>Feeling extremely drowsy—I struggled to even sit up-right. For minutes I sat on the bed, dozing off as I stared blankly at nothing; almost as though the wirings of my mind had short-circuited.</p>
                                <p>Though once they reconnected, I glanced at the ticking clock…</p>
                                <p>Seven… forty-two..? I finally rose to my feet, each step towards the bathroom grew heavier. It was unusual that I woke up this late, so I had to make haste.</p>
                                <p>Although once I stood before the bathroom mirror, I stared at myself for a second—struggling to keep an open eye.</p>
                                <p>My bangs’ all messed up..</p>
                                <p>There I reached for the shelf, searching for my toothbrush; but the shelf was empty. I moved my hand around, yet I still couldn’t find my brush..</p>
                                <p>In a daze I took a step back, opening my eyes properly to look.. and there it was, resting in a mug, leaning to the left.. But I was certain I couldn’t feel it earlier..?</p>
                                <p>After I brushed my teeth and washed my face—I returned to my bedroom and took my school uniform. I leisurely took my time as I undressed my pajamas and wore the uniform, combing my hair with my fingers to ensure I didn’t have bed hair.</p>
                                <p>Once I got my school bag and wore my shoes, I locked the door behind me and set off to school.</p>
                                <p>The cold morning air greeted me—blissfully I’d say.</p>
                                <p>I glanced at my watch and noticed it was already 8 o’clock, I had thirty minutes to spare… And while I physically kept walking forward, my mind wandered elsewhere.</p>
                                <p>It’s been a while since I read the letter, and it has laid dormant on my study desk ever since. I didn’t really have the guts to throw it away.. but I didn’t even do anything with it ever since I took it home.</p>
                                <p>I passed through the school gates, my mind still pondering on. I simply proceeded, walking blankly up the stairs—towards my designated classroom, carrying my bag.</p>
                                <p>Turning the corner, I was immediately snapped out of my thoughts as it felt like I crashed into a solid wall; jolted back as I landed on the floor. The contents of my bag spilled as I unknowingly had left it unzipped…</p>
                                <p> There he paused, Hayashi. “..I’ll get back to you later.” he continued on, his speed incredibly immense as he blurred past me. He didn’t even help me up or gather my things.. what a gentleman.</p>
                                <p>I sat there like an abandoned cat, with no choice but to watch him disappear around the corner whilst I scratched my head. Though I planned on getting up, a hand was extended towards me.. it was the guy who hit on me.</p>
                                <p>Still, I stood up without taking his offered hand. “I didn’t tell you my name last time, you okay?” he chuckled. “That was a strange guy.” I picked and swiftly gathered my things, ignoring his presence—but extremely bothered by his lingering stare.</p>
                                <p>Once I stood, I turned away and began walking.</p>
                                <p>“You’re welcome Aihara-san, the name’s Sakuragi.” he said despite not having accepted any of his help. “If you’re free later, meet me at the school gate okay?”</p>
                                <p>It really bothers me… I thought I’d made it clear last time..</p>
                                <p>Although I was extremely bothered, I still proceeded to the classroom. Sitting in silence once I settled in my seat, waiting for a specific someone to show up.</p>
                                <p>It felt like forever, until I heard his footsteps.</p>
                                <p>There he was, the person who bumped into me earlier. The one who toppled me over and didn’t even stop to help me. That guy who has the audacity to sit beside me without the smallest apology.</p>
                                <p>I stared at him, expecting something to happen, he did say he’d get back to me later didn’t he? But impatience took over me—I needed to complain; but he suddenly placed a juice box on my table. “What’s this?”</p>
                                <p>“Apple juice, I thought it’d be fair since I bumped into you earlier.” he said.</p>
                                <p>“<i>Hoh</i>.. Is that so?” I replied, a slight smile crept up my face as I scanned the beverage, I found it quite amusing. “Why were you in such a rush anyway?”</p>
                                <p>“Well…” he remained silent and gave me the look that I wouldn’t want to know.</p>
                                <p>“Hayashi!!!” yelled from the outside, the voice of an old man… the librarian.</p>
                                <p>“I was running away from that old man… I knocked over a cart of books.” he said in a monotonous manner, almost as though it was normal; and it struck me as funny.</p>
                                <p>“..Need help?”</p>
                                <p>“Will you? Although I won’t owe you another juice box.”</p>
                                <p>“Yes you will.” he stood up and I followed suit.</p>
                                <p>For the first time, I was walking alongside someone.. Then I noticed the height difference.</p>
                                <p>“How tall are you?” I asked, staring up at him.</p>
                                <p>“Last time I checked… 176 centimeters.” he said, glancing down at me. Here I stood at 164 centimeters… “Your height’s just right, don’t fret over it.”</p>
                                <p>Huh.. he thinks I’m embarrassed about my height? It’s far from that… I just went silent because our height difference was quite ideal for couples.. or that’s what I heard… but of course we’re merely seatmates.</p>
                                <p>For the times we've interacted… I’ve developed some sort of image of him. I’d say he’s smart—calculated in how he acts… and.. behaved..? No scrap that one.</p>
                                <p>Although.. I didn’t expect he’d knock over something in the library—and run from it… it’s out of the image I’ve conjured of him. Still—it doesn’t necessarily make him a bad guy, he was just weirder than I thought.</p>
                                <p>This guy is truly unusual, what a seatmate I have.</p>
                                <p>Furthermore.. the fact that I’m talking to him so casually, is this alright..?</p>
                                <p>I can’t deny that I’m a bit too curious to let him go now.. Maybe I’ll see this through… just for a little longer.</p>
                                <p>“Just what exactly happened earlier?” I couldn’t help but ask.</p>
                                <p>“I woke up earlier than usual… Then I arrived too early, so I thought about burning time in the library. Why don’t you guess what happened?”</p>
                                <p>“You told me you knocked a cart earlier..”</p>
                                <p>“What about the reason?” he pointed out, really making me guess.</p>
                                <p>“It happened because you’re an idiot.”</p>
                                <p>“Wow, that’s how you see me?” he said, caught off guard from my comment. “I was looking around the library, until someone threw a book at me.” he said with such a serious face. “I dodged it of course, but I stumbled upon the cart of books the librarian set aside, and it toppled over. I would’ve apologized and helped fix it but he seemed like he planned on throwing more books at me, so I ran.”</p>
                                <p>“How comical.” I spoke flatly, holding back a laugh.</p>
                                <p>“It’s strange isn’t it?”</p>
                                <p>“Extremely.”</p>
