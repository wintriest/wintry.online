                                <h1>Chapter 2.3</h1>
                                <p>..It smells like… concrete..?</p>
                                <p>My cheeks were pressed against something rough and cold.. While my body ached like never before… I struggled to open my eyes again, but was softly greeted by the calm breeze.</p>
                                <p>Once I could see, everything was sideways.</p>
                                <p>Did I.. really fall over in my sleep..?</p>
                                <p>I wasn’t lying on the floor when I slept…</p>
                                <p>..At least I didn’t fall towards Hayashi.</p>
                                <p>It would’ve been embarrassing if I did…</p>
                                <p><i>Ugh</i>.. I pushed myself upwards, struggling with the mess my hair turned into.</p>
                                <p>Once again, I rested my back against the wall and let out a sigh of relief. My neck feels stiff… but I feel much better…</p>
                                <p>..Didn’t Hayashi say he’d wake me up?</p>
                                <p>I glanced to my side and saw him sitting with his arms crossed, his head tilted downwards… So much talk about waking me up once needed.. you fell asleep yourself.</p>
                                <p>Though still.. he really didn’t do anything.</p>
                                <p>That eases my heart…</p>
                                <p>..I stared at him.</p>
                                <p>His hands—veiny.. and his hair still messy.</p>
                                <p>…I wonder why he’s so easy to talk to..?</p>
                                <p>Like a siren—the school bell rang extremely loud, why would it...?</p>
                                <p>I glanced at my watch..</p>
                                <p>This idiot..!</p>
                                <p>I grabbed his blazer and began pulling him upwards as I stood, I can’t afford to be late..!</p>
                                <p>“You said you’d wake me up… why’d you sleep?!” he jolted awake as I kept trying to pull him up.</p>
                                <p>Regardless of how much effort I exerted, I wasn’t physically able to pull him up—though he immediately came to his senses and stood on his own accord..</p>
                                <p>Just as Hayashi locked the door, the school bell had already stopped ringing; rushing us further as we quickly flew down the flight of stairs.</p>
                                <p>It’s been so long since I’ve been in this kind of trouble..</p>
                                <p>As I panted, I slid the classroom door open—proving my fears correct as Amano-sensei was already at the front..</p>
                                <p>“You’re late, where were you?” she asked in the midst of taking attendance.</p>
                                <p>I stared at him, unsure of what to say as I couldn’t conjure an excuse.</p>
                                <p>I can’t really tell her we were on the rooftop…</p>
                                <p>..We’re being stared at—they’re whispering at each other…</p>
                                <p>“We assisted in the library—we rearranged books on the shelves so we were a little late to take our lunch.”</p>
                                <p>…This guy—he still keeps breaking my image of him.. word by word.</p>
                                <p>“..You were the two who volunteered in the library?” Amano-sensei mentioned and we nodded—she seemed to believe us… Well, we really did rearrange books this morning.. “Just go back to your seat I guess, I won’t mark the both of you as late.”</p>
                                <p>Though my legs wobbled, we finally managed to sit. For a moment I caught my breath, then glanced at Hayashi who let out a sigh.</p>
                                <p>He turned to me, sharing eye contact—and a common sense of relief.</p>
                                <p>..That was stressful.</p>
                                <p>I’m never sleeping at school again…</p>
                                <p>…With our late attendance to Amano-sensei’s class, I made sure to listen—taking notes as I attentively listened to her recall the topics we’ve had for this semester before the exams..</p>
                                <p>From the very beginning of Newton’s Law of Motion… to Kinematics—Vectors.. and Projectiles; to whatever kind of energy we were even talking about…</p>
                                <p>..This is why I didn’t want to be late; I wouldn’t have any feeling of guilt.</p>
                                <p>But since I was… I had to make sure I seemed worthy of being excused.</p>
                                <p>…Yet as I stared at my notebook, filled to the brim with pointers for the upcoming exams—I turned to my seat mate; sleeping peacefully.</p>
                                <p>..You’re ridiculous Hayashi.</p>
                                <p>Though once Amano-sensei’s classes had passed, I returned to staring outside the window—resting my cheek on my palm as I ignored the following class.</p>
                                <p>My mind now strayed from the lessons, laying idle as I mindlessly stared outside. Amidst this mess I got myself into… it’s only now I remembered the letter I read earlier..</p>
                                <p>…Why did the letter want me to make a friend..?</p>
                                <p>It’s strange…</p>
                                <p>I’m already somewhat—I don’t know how to… I guess I’m acquainted with Hayashi, I formed it by my own accords; but having someone tell me to do so..</p>
                                <p>I don’t like it.</p>
                                <p>…I shouldn’t be thinking about this inside the classroom..</p>
                                <p>..As I turned to look around the room, the teacher was in the midst of discussing something… whilst Hayashi was still sleeping..</p>
                                <p>Should I just sleep as well..?</p>
                                <p>…I listened to the discussion for a bit..</p>
                                <p>..He’s just recalling the previous topics.</p>
                                <p>There I buried my face in my arms on the table, shutting myself off from the world; wanting the day to pass by faster.</p>
                                <p>Just so I wouldn’t think about that letter anymore..</p>
                                <p>...</p>
                                <p>…I stirred awake, a hand felt upon my shoulder..</p>
                                <p>Though I struggled, I pushed myself upwards—looking around the room, turning to my right… seeing Hayashi with his hand extended towards me.</p>
                                <p>He pointed to the clock on the wall… it’s almost homeroom..</p>
                                <p>Then before he could—I turned to the mirror to fix my hair.</p>
                                <p>…I slept too much today..</p>
                                <p>..It seems as though the last period just gave the students time to study… he probably woke me up early just in case.</p>
                                <p>He should’ve just woken me up later..</p>
                                <p>I don’t have anything to do.</p>
                                <p>..To ease this listlessness, I retreated to what I’ve been avoiding. My hand reached inside my blazer, taking out the letter earlier.</p>
                                <p>Though strangely enough—something else came with it.</p>
                                <p>Falling from my blazer pocket, to my lap..</p>
                                <p>…A second letter..</p>
                                <p>..There should only be one…</p>
                                <p>…Why are there two?</p>
                                <p>I immediately checked the one in my hand—the letter I read earlier..</p>
                                <p>How could’ve someone put this inside my blazer..?</p>
                                <p>Returning the letter inside my blazer, then picking up the new one..</p>
                                <p>..With a bit of hesitation, I ripped it open.</p>
                                <div class="window">
                                    <div class="text-bar">

                                <p>..It’s different.</p>
                                <p>The handwriting’s still the same but…</p>
                                <p>I snuck a glance towards Hayashi… could he have put this inside my blazer..?</p>
                                <p>…No way—I would’ve felt him touch me if that’s the case..</p>
                                <p>I didn’t sleep with my blazer open.. there’s no way he unbuttoned it without me noticing…</p>
                                <p>..Then again, it was just the two of us earlier…</p>
                                <p>Unless it really is…</p>
                                <p>…This is frustrating..</p>
                                <p>Is this real…?</p>
                                <p>..Are you real?</p>
                                <p>…If you really do love me… just tell me who you are..</p>
                                <p>I thought things could go back to normal after that nap on the rooftop..</p>
                                <p>..It’s only getting worse.</p>
                                <p>For the rest of the homeroom—I remained silent, oblivious to what occurred around me…</p>
                                <p>Only coming to my senses once everyone’s chairs began moving..</p>
                                <p>I guess it’s time to go home…</p>
                                <p>..Just—who is this future lover?</p>
                                <p>What journey are you talking about..?</p>
                                <p>…Am I not by your side in the future?</p>
                                <p>For a moment I stood, picking up my bag which felt… heavier..</p>
                                <p>..Passing through the busy hallway.</p>
                                <p>I don’t want to think about this anymore..</p>
                                <p>Stop making fun of me already…</p>
                                <p>..With the metal clanking of the shoe lockers—I turned to mine, wearing my outdoor shoes before exiting the school building.</p>
                                <p>…I don’t want to go home yet.</p>
                                <p>I turned around—checking to see if he was anywhere near… there; Hayashi’s wearing his shoes..</p>
                                <p>As I stood, waiting for him to finish.. He eventually walked up and noticed me…</p>
                                <p>“..What is it?” he asked, adjusting the strap of his bag on his shoulder.</p>
                                <p>“Are you going home…?” I asked him awkwardly, but he simply nodded to my question. “...You’re not going to the garden?”</p>
                                <p>“Is there anything you need?” he asked, too casually..</p>
                                <p>“...I suppose not..” I muttered, laying my head low.</p>
                                <p>“..Take care, Aihara.” he said before walking past me..</p>
                                <p>…There really is no reason for him to stay with me..</p>
                                <p>I thought I could distract myself… if it was with him.</p>
                                <p>..I sought comfort in the garden—by myself, to sort my thoughts…</p>
                                <p>If it was Hayashi, he would’ve come with me here.</p>
                                <p>Hence… I don’t think it’s him..</p>
                                <p>..But there’s no other candidate than him…</p>
                                <p>…I need to..</p>
                                <p>Wait…</p>
                                <p>…</p>
                                <p>..Last month, I received three letters… which I all disregarded and threw to the trash… The fourth letter followed—suddenly telling me it came from the future..</p>
                                <p>..The fifth letter which I got from the library suggested I associate with someone in the hopes that I end up talking to my future lover…</p>
                                <p>Then this sixth letter… only saying how he wants to end the journey with me..</p>
                                <p>…What journey..?</p>
                                <p>I really can’t get my head around this… I just can’t understand it..</p>
                                <p>..I reached into my blazer again—pulling out the letter.</p>
                                <p>…This appeared inside the fourth letter as well..</p>
                                <p>..Does that similarity even bear any significance?</p>
                                <p>He said it himself… he’s unsure if the letters do actually reach me—maybe he’s just sending letters over and over again just to be sure..? But how would he even send it..? From the future?? How would he even make letters appear out of thin air?! Like??</p>
                                <p>..This is just absurd…</p>
                                <p>This isn’t real…</p>
                                <p>…I’m playing dumb with myself; believing in all this play..</p>
                                <p>I’m practically putting myself in line to become a laughing stock…</p>
                                <p>..Since when did I become a fool..?</p>
                                <p>I leaned back on the bench, helplessly staring at the sky.</p>
                                <p>…The once golden sunlight—now pale..</p>
                                <p>..I shouldn’t have stayed here…</p>
                                <p>I should’ve followed Hayashi..</p>
                                <p>…Though I suppose we’re not that close..</p>
                                <p>..It’s getting colder.</p>
                                <p>I should go home already…</p>
                                <p>Hah… I held onto the bench—before closing my eyes as I pushed myself up; then there it went, the letters fell from my lap.. to the ground…</p>
                                <p>I stared at it for a moment longer.</p>
                                <p>I’ll leave it here… I’ll..</p>
                                <p>…Yet I leaned forward, crouching as I picked the letters up and stuffed it in my bag.</p>
                                <p>..So hopeless, me.</p>
                                <p>The chilling wind brushed against my face once I stood—leaving me to silently walk. Flowing through the path to leave the garden, making way to the front of the school building; continuing down the path to the school gate.</p>
                                <p>There were a few other students walking as well… probably those who stayed behind for club activities or class duties.</p>
                                <p id="restore-point">..Though it wasn’t just them who stayed behind.</p>

                                    <p class="anomaly">The guy who’s been trying too hard to harass me; Sakuragi..</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">He leaned on the school gate surrounded by many students… is he popular or something..?</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">Just as I got closer, I noticed he was holding what appeared to be a white envelope. With such proximity, he eventually noticed me—hiding the envelope behind his back… wait, what was that..?</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">Was that a letter…?</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">It was pure white..</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">No… no.. wait… why was he holding that?</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">No please.. Him…?</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">..He’s been the one giving me these letters?</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">So he snuck into my apartment…?</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">He followed me to the rooftop..?</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">…He knew I’d get to that shelf in the library?</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">So he’s from the future…?</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">Or was he the one pretending..??</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">There he stared, the crowd around him dispersing as he made his way to me. “I found something..” he whispered—taking the envelope and boldly showing it off to everyone..</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">He found it..?</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">…So it isn’t from him?</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">“I can’t believe there’s someone who wants to steal you from me..” he chuckled. “This guy is even calling himself your future lover!” he suddenly laughed, sharing it all with the other students. “So? Who’s been writing these?”</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">..I have all the letters on me… he shouldn’t have one—unless..</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">It's a new one.</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">“Mizuki, I found this under your desk; you can’t be hiding secrets from me.” he suddenly stated, his glance switching between me and the letter.</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">..Why is this guy calling me by my name?</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">“What are you…?” I muttered, suddenly surrounded by everyone as he continued to read the letter.</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">“Are you into this kind of thing? Mizuki?”</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly" id="detect-point">I don’t… What is..</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">“Hey, answer me.” he dropped the letter—stepping closer with every step. “I can believe you’d even believe in these kinds of things.” he sighed.</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">..What was written on that letter?</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">…Why is this happening to me..?</p>

                                    <p>I looked at the ground—firmly holding my bag as I wanted to pass through quietly..</p>
                                    <p>“Aihara-san! I’m glad you came—” An arm draped over my shoulder..</p>
                                    <p>Immediately I pushed him away, tightly gripping the strap of my school bag; taking a few steps back to distance myself from him. Did he really just.. do that?</p>
                                    <p>This guy who has been trying too hard to harass me.. Sakuragi.</p>
                                    <p>What does he think he’s doing?</p>
                                    <p>Who are these people..?</p>
                                    <p>Almost too quickly, they surrounded us…</p>
                                    <p>“Look at everyone, they wanted to meet you Aihara-san; they’ve been curious about the girl who’s been rejecting me.” he chuckled—pulling me into the sudden spotlight. “They’re not coming with us, don’t worry.” he whispered. “You’re free now right? I won’t be letting you go.” he said as he held onto my wrist—waving goodbye to the people, but I slapped his hand away, distancing myself further; yet still surrounded by the group.</p>
                                    <p>..Their eyes digging into me slowly—watching each and every action I made… too carefully.</p>
                                    <p>“Why are you doing this?” I squeezed my hand.</p>
                                    <p>“Didn’t I tell you to meet me at the school gate if you wanted to go on a date?” he mentioned, acting confused.</p>
                                    <p>I didn’t agree to anything…</p>
                                    <p>“I didn’t come here for you.” I stated, looking around—pierced by their prying eyes. “You were merely in the way.”</p>
                                    <p>..He waited here, so I wouldn’t have the means to escape.</p>
                                    <p>“Playing hard to get again Aihara-san… it gets unpleasant over time you know?” he shrugged his shoulders as he approached me again.</p>
                                    <p>“..What’s wrong with you?” I questioned as I further distanced myself, turning to walk away yet—there they stood. “What are you staring for?” I glared at them, which immediately made them disperse.</p>
                                    <p>There… I stormed off through the school gate.</p>
                                    <p>Their gaze—trailing behind..</p>
                                    <p>His presense… nothing but discomfort..</p>
