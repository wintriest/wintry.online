                                <h1>Chapter 2.3</h1>
                                <p>..It smells like… concrete..?</p>
                                <p>My cheeks were pressed against something rough and cold.. While my body ached like never before… I struggled to open my eyes again, but was softly greeted by the calm breeze.</p>
                                <p>Once I could see, my world view was sideways.</p>
                                <p>Did I.. really fall over in my sleep..?</p>
                                <p>I wasn’t lying on the floor when I slept…</p>
                                <p>Though thankfully I didn’t fall towards Hayashi.. It would’ve been embarrassing if I did…</p>
                                <p>Most importantly.. I pushed myself upwards, struggling with the mess my hair turned into.</p>
                                <p>Once again, I rested my back against the wall and let out a sigh of relief. My body may have ached, but I managed to rest well…</p>
                                <p>..Didn’t Hayashi say he’d wake me up?</p>
                                <p>I glanced at my side and saw him sitting with his arms crossed, his head tilted downwards… So much talk about waking me up once needed.. you fell asleep yourself.</p>
                                <p>Though still.. he really didn’t do anything.</p>
                                <p>That eases my heart…</p>
                                <p>I stared at him.</p>
                                <p>His hands—veiny.. and his hair still messy.</p>
                                <p>I wonder why it’s so easy to talk to him?</p>
                                <p>…</p>
                                <p>I’m still dozing off… hm..?</p>
                                <p>I was late to notice but… resting against my leg.</p>
                                <p>A letter..?</p>
                                <p>I stretched forward to reach it, and quickly hid it in my blazer.</p>
                                <p>Despite my eagerness to read, Hayashi may wake up…</p>
                                <p>Wait—Hayashi..?</p>
                                <p>Why would the letter appear now..? When I… associated with someone?</p>
                                <p>Did he put it here?</p>
                                <p>No.. no way… I don’t think he would do something so obvious..</p>
                                <p>But why now..?</p>
                                <p>It’s just the two of us here.. right?</p>
                                <p>Then, like a siren—the school bell rang extremely loud, why would it..?</p>
                                <p>I glanced at my watch..</p>
                                <p>…</p>
                                <p>This idiot!</p>
                                <p>I grabbed his blazer and began pulling him upwards, we’re late!!</p>
                                <p>“You said you’d wake me up–why’d you sleep?!” he jolted awake.</p>
                                <p>Although I couldn’t pull him up, he immediately came to his senses and stood up.</p>
                                <p>We were so late that the school bell had already stopped ringing, so we quickly fled down the flight of stairs.</p>
                                <p>It’s been so long since I’ve been in this kind of trouble..</p>
                                <p>“You’re late, where were you?” the teacher asked in the midst of starting a discussion.</p>
                                <p>I stared at him, still fresh from my sleep—bearing no idea of what to say. It’s not like we could say we were on the rooftop… Of course, some girls were quick to whisper, we must’ve been a strange pair.</p>
                                <p>“We assisted in the library, rearranging books on the shelves.”</p>
                                <p>This guy.. he still keeps breaking my mental image of him… word by word.</p>
                                <p>“Really? I was there earlier, I didn’t see you two.”</p>
                                <p>“We were probably eating lunch.” he lied, so blatantly.. We did that this morning, not lunch…</p>
                                <p>“...I see, just go back to your seat. I won’t mark the both of you as late, it was just a few minutes anyway.”</p>
                                <p>When we finally managed to sit, I glanced at Hayashi.</p>
                                <p>He also glanced at me, sharing a common sense of relief.</p>
                                <p>For a while, I sat in class listening.</p>
                                <p>Yet my focus wasn’t there… The letter was stuck in my head, what was written in the one I just picked up..?</p>
                                <p>I glanced at the teacher.. at Hayashi… none of them were looking, so I pulled out the letter. I looked at it under my desk and tore it open..</p>
                                <div class="window">
                                    <div class="text-bar">

                                    </div>
                                    <div class="window-content letter-file">
                                        <p class="unusual">Just to reach the end of this journey with you by my side…</p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <p>Just… one sentence.. no remarks… no—other notes..?</p>
                                <p>It’s different..</p>
                                <p>Though… the handwriting’s the same..</p>
                                <p>I snuck a glance towards Hayashi… he too wasn’t paying attention in class. Could it be that.. this came from him?</p>
                                <p>It was just the two of us there earlier…</p>
                                <p>But again, no way… wouldn’t it blow his cover if it was him?</p>
                                <p>Ughh… what even is this…?</p>
                                <p>If you really do love me.. why won’t you just tell me who you are..?</p>
                                <p>Just when I thought things could be normal after that peaceful nap on the rooftop.. it progressively got worse when I woke up and found that letter.</p>
                                <p>For the few remaining classes, I stared off into the distance. Not knowing what to do.. not knowing what to believe in.</p>
                                <p>Just… who are you?</p>
                                <p>What journey.. are you talking about..?</p>
                                <p>This is unbearable…</p>
                                <p>Perhaps I didn’t notice, but all classes had come to a halt.</p>
                                <p>I don’t even know how long I got stuck in a trance..</p>
                                <p>Though once I stood to leave the school, Hayashi was walking behind me—maybe if I’m with him… I can distract myself from the letters?</p>
                                <p>I kept walking, listening for his footsteps, wondering if he’s still behind.</p>
                                <p>Once we wore our outdoor shoes and exited the school building, I turned around to look at him, stopping him from walking past me.</p>
                                <p>“What is it?” he asked.</p>
                                <p>“Are you going home?”</p>
                                <p>“Yeah.” he answered, giving me a curious look.</p>
                                <p>“I’ll stay in the garden for now…” I muttered.</p>
                                <p>“..Take care, Aihara.” he said before walking past me.</p>
                                <p>…</p>
                                <p>By myself, I sought comfort in the garden to sort my thoughts..</p>
                                <p>I don’t think Hayashi would write such letters…</p>
                                <p>But there’s no other candidate than him..</p>
                                <p>Hold on…</p>
                                <p>So far I’ve received three letters—the first three I never managed to read. The fourth letter just told me that it came from the future, the fifth letter suggested I associate with someone in the hope that it’s actually him… and this sixth letter.. only saying that he wants to end the journey with me.</p>
                                <p>I scratched my head…</p>
                                <p>I’m so frustrated.. I really can’t get my head around this… I just can’t.. understand it…</p>
                                <p>Though I did notice.. the sixth letter’s sentence did appear somewhere in the fourth letter as well.. but does that similarity even bear any significance?? …He said it himself—he’s unsure if the letters do actually reach me, maybe he’s just sending letters over and over again just to be sure? Wait, what do I mean by sending??? How could he even send letters to those exact places when he’s from the future?! How would something from the future come here in the first place?! Like, how is this even true?!? …I’m just playing dumb with myself.. believing in all this play, I’m practically leading myself to become a laughing stock once it’s revealed I’m actually being pranked…</p>
                                <p>…</p>
                                <p>I leaned back on the bench, helplessly staring at the sky.</p>
                                <p>Once the golden sunlight, now pale..</p>
                                <p>The wind has become chilly… I need to go home.</p>
                                <p>As I stood, the letters fell from my lap.</p>
                                <p>I stared at it for a moment and closed my eyes. I thought about leaving it there… but I quickly picked it up and stuffed it in my bag.</p>
                                <p>Silently… I walked. Flowing through the path alongside the few other students who stayed behind for club activities and class duties. But it wasn’t just them who were on the campus..</p>
                                <div class="anomaly-group" data-id="group-1">
                                    <p class="anomaly">I looked ahead and… what..?</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">The guy who gets on my nerves, Sakuragi..</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">He was leaning on the school gate, holding what appeared to be… a <b>letter</b>..? Once he noticed, he suddenly hid it behind his back.</p>
                                    <p class="anomaly">Hold on.. wait… wait.. why was he holding that? Is he the..?</p>
                                </div>
                                <p>“Aihara-san!” someone called, putting an arm over my shoulder.</p>
                                <p>I immediately pushed him away, tightly gripping the strap of my school bag; taking a few steps back to distance myself from him. Did he really just.. do that?</p>
                                <p>The guy who gets on my nerves, Sakuragi if I heard it right..</p>
                                <p>What does he think he’s doing?</p>
                                <p>And who are these people..?</p>
                                <p>“I’m glad you came! My friends wanted to meet you Aihara-san, they’ve been curious about you as well.” he said with a smile. “But don’t worry, they’re not coming with us. You’re free now right? You’re always busy so I won't let you go today!” he said before holding onto my wrist, which I immediately pushed away, distancing myself further.</p>
                                <p>“Why are you doing this?”</p>
                                <p>“You came here just like I asked you to, so I thought you agreed to go on a date today?” he said, acting confused.</p>
                                <p>I didn’t agree to anything..?</p>
                                <p>“I didn’t come here for you.” I stated, looking around the area. “You were simply in the way.”</p>
                                <p>Now that I recall… he did tell me to meet him at the school gate if I’m free. But why specifically at the school gate..? Wasn’t that kind of indirectly telling me I’m not getting away? Like, there’s no way I can leave school without passing through the gate..</p>
                                <p>“You’re playing hard to get again Aihara-san.. It can get quite unpleasant if it’s always done though?”</p>
                                <p>“..What’s wrong with you?” I questioned before walking around him and storming off through the school gate.</p>
                                <p>His presence… it brings nothing but discomfort..</p>
