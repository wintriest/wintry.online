                                        <p class="subject">Mizuki, my beloved.</p>
                                        <p>Greeting you once again—your future lover. I’ve realized that counting the letters I send is futile, not everything will wind up in your path. No matter the advances in technology I’ve gone through here in the future, the nature of time itself is still difficult to break. But I do firmly believe that you’re receiving some of these letters, I hope you are so I can give you a heads up, and also prove that this indeed comes from the future and I am your lover.</p>
                                        <p>The reason why I’ve been contacting you and not the Mizuki in the future, is a reason that is not fit for you to know of. It will mess with the timeline. But I can tell you that around the second week of October, you’re still a nobody in the classroom.</p>
                                        <p>But don’t fret, I’ve seen the changes you’ve gone through and you only need to do one thing to overcome this dilemma of yours. I’m sure you don’t consider it a dilemma however, it’s been your nature to confine yourself and not open up to others.</p>
                                        <p>What I suggest you do is to make a friend, even an acquaintance if that’s what you’d prefer. Somewhere in the future you’ve complained about not meeting me sooner. So why not associate yourself with someone in the hopes that it’s actually me?</p>
                                        <p class="signed">-your future lover.</p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <p>My eyes flinched—it was indeed the second week of October… but did he really have to say it like that? Well… it’s true, I’m still a nobody… hold on, <i>still</i>..?</p>
                                <p>Does that mean.. I <i>won’t</i> be a nobody in the future?</p>
                                <p>Wait.. wait—wait, everyone knows I’m a nobody.. this shouldn’t be enough to convince me.</p>
                                <p>Though his last words… associate..? It wouldn’t hurt to try.. would it?</p>
                                <p>Associate myself with others… even an acquaintance is fine.</p>
                                <p>..My future lover… I think I’ve already done what you’re asking of me.. I was in the middle of it when you popped up.</p>
                                <p>Taking a moment to process everything said.. is far from easy.</p>
                                <p>Just.. What is the reason that they keep sending letters over..? From the future? Is my future lover unable to contact me in their current timeline?</p>
                                <p>Well, that doesn’t matter.</p>
                                <p>Like… can I even believe this?</p>
                                <p>There I sat, wondering what to do..</p>
                                <p>I glanced to my right and saw him reading a novel.</p>
                                <p>I was associating with him rather fine earlier, I felt comfortable talking for the first time. Maybe it’d be easier to try further if it’s with him..?</p>
                                <p>“...” though I planned to call him, I found it hard to speak.</p>
                                <p>But I was able to talk fine just earlier?</p>
                                <p>Am I feeling… shy?</p>
                                <p>No… far from it—it’s just a bit unusual for me to be calling someone. If I wanted to, I’d do it straight away.</p>
                                <p>…</p>
                                <p>I looked at him, his eyes tracing the words in the novel.</p>
                                <p>“...What are.. your plans for lunch..?” I asked, with a voice too low. I couldn’t muster up the confidence.</p>
                                <p>I stared at him longer, still unaware of my presence.</p>
                                <p>“Hey.” I called, but it still didn’t reach him.</p>
                                <p>Nevermind, there’s no need to associate with others. I’m doing just fine, he’ll only get to my nerves if I keep pressing.</p>
                                <p>“What is it?” he asked, only now noticing me; perhaps I glared at him too much. He sat there staring at me, wondering why I was staring at him—I turned to look outside the window, having lost all the motivation since he didn’t notice me earlier.</p>
                                <p>“Nothing.” I rested my chin on my palm and let out a sigh as I stared at the outside world.</p>
                                <p>“...”</p>
                                <p>“Lunch.” I mumbled.</p>
                                <p>“What about it?” he asked, finally caught on.</p>
                                <p>“Where do you usually eat?”</p>
                                <p>“Oh, I eat on the rooftop.” he whispered.</p>
                                <p>“What? Students are banned from stepping foot on the rooftop, no?” I asked, confused, but he simply put a finger over his lips.</p>
                                <p>Is he serious..?</p>
                                <p>“You know I can report you right?” I mentioned, giving him a side glance. “...Let me tag along.”</p>
                                <p>“Fine by me.”</p>
                                <p>Soon—the bells rang, and he stood up with me right behind him. I wasn’t letting him get out of my sight. So I followed as he climbed up the stairs. Each floor, the students lessened—until we arrived at the locked rooftop door.</p>
                                <p>“So, how do you get in?” I asked. He looked at me, observing my reaction before pulling out a key from his blazer. “Where did you..?”</p>
                                <p>“Hmm… someone gave it to me.”</p>
                                <p>“Who did?”</p>
                                <p>“Someone you wouldn’t know.”</p>
                                <p>..He had this mischievous look…</p>
                                <p>“...You stole it.”</p>
                                <p>“I didn’t.” he shook his head. “I just didn’t ask for permission.”</p>
                                <p>“You have a screw loose somewhere..”</p>
                                <p>“Do I?” he asked—unlocking the rooftop door without looking back.</p>
                                <p>Setting upon the forbidden rooftop, the calming breeze washed upon my face, allowing me to take a moment of pause. This place… is very quiet..</p>
                                <p>“How long have you been going here?” I asked, taking in the fresh air.</p>
                                <p>“It’s been months..” he grunted as he sat on the floor, resting his back against the wall. Though I expected something else, all he’s having for lunch was a mere.. sandwich…</p>
                                <p>Even I.. can’t get full eating just that.</p>
                                <p>Having adored the view and the fresh breeze too much, I turned towards Hayashi and sat down beside him.  “Is that all you’re having for lunch?”</p>
                                <p>“It’s plenty.” he said before taking a bite.</p>
                                <p>I sat still, letting out a sigh as I rested my back against the wall.</p>
                                <p>“This breeze is making me sleepy..” I muttered.</p>
                                <p>“Then sleep, I’ll wake you up once needed.”</p>
                                <p>“That doesn’t reassure me in the slightest.” I stated. “You’re not going to do anything to me while I sleep right..?”</p>
                                <p>“What kind of image do you have of me?”</p>
                                <p>“Don’t know, your image inside my head has bent even the fabric of reality…” I said before closing my eyes and settling in my position, it’s not like I had a pillow or back rest I could use.</p>
                                <p>“Don’t tell me you’re skipping lunch.” he suddenly said. “You didn’t even bring a snack… here.” Hayashi split his already small sandwich and handed one to me.</p>
                                <p>“I didn’t ask for it.”</p>
                                <p>“But I’m giving it to you.”</p>
                                <p>Although I often skipped lunch, I grabbed the sandwich he was offering me. I took a small bite and tasted… eggs and something creamy.. there was ham as well… It may have been small, but it was enough to fill my appetite..</p>
                                <p>I tenderly savored the taste before finally closing my eyes.</p>
                                <p>Hah…</p>
                                <p>The wind hitting my face feels just right… It’s so comfortable that it feels like.. I can forget everything… And I can really be just—a regular student..</p>
                                <p>Future lover this..</p>
                                <p>My dearest this…</p>
                                <p>I just want to live my school life.. normally.</p>
                                <p>In this world—there’s not a single soul that can fall in love with the true me. Nothing interests me… I’m comfortable as long as I continue my way..</p>
                                <p>But these letters..</p>
                                <p>They seem to hold something far greater..</p>
                                <p>Is it real..?</p>
                                <p>…</p>
                                <p>I should stop dwelling on them and just live the life I long for.</p>
                                <p>As long as I have me..</p>
                                <p>I’m good enough.</p>
