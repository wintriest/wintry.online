                                <h1>Chapter 1.1</h1>
                                <p>For times when the clock just ticks too slow, my mind ponders—unclear of what to do. I just stare far beyond, admiring the view of the outside. Perhaps if I get a little lost in it, time will flow by faster…</p>
                                <p>As slow as life has been, it appears different to the others in class. They’re moving a lot faster. Like they’re in an entirely different realm from where I reside. Is it due to my aloofness? My detachment from the social aspect of life? Well, regardless… there’s no need to ponder—class is finished and I’m in class duty.</p>
                                <p>I looked around, observing the other student I’m scheduled with. But there they go, immediately off to the hallway, laughing with friends, leaving me alone for duty. But it struck me just right.. as from the start, I’ve lived comfortably as a loner in class.</p>
                                <p>The board was filled with equations, our final class was Mathematics, whoever placed that subject during such a slow period must be on par with the devil himself.</p>
                                <p>Beside the equations, a few students had doodled with colored chalks. Though it shouldn’t hurt to erase them, they aren’t really supposed to draw on the board after all.</p>
                                <p>Though I struggled to reach for the higher parts, I kept erasing the board until I heard some people enter the classroom.</p>
                                <p>“Hey, Aihara-san.. right?” a bunch of girls approached me.</p>
                                <p>“Hm?”</p>
                                <p>“A few guys from the neighboring schools saw you in our class photo, they wanted to talk to you!”</p>
                                <p>“...” My hand fell to my side, holding the eraser firmly. “...can’t you tell them that I’m not interested?” I scratched my cheek with the other.</p>
                                <p>“Oh come on~ Just an hour! We’re also missing one person!” they pleaded with me.</p>
                                <p>“Maybe you could even find someone you like?” one giggled.</p>
                                <p>“No.. I’m not interested.” I stared at them awkwardly. “I’m preoccupied.”</p>
                                <p>As expected, their cheerful facade had vanished. Their interested and vibrant expressions turned sour. But I didn’t mind, this is just how I am—it has always been like this. So there’s no need to fret Mizuki.</p>
                                <p>“<i>Tch</i>… I told you she’s a loner.” I heard their faint conversations along the hallway continue.</p>
                                <p>And acting like I couldn’t hear them badmouthing me, I continued erasing the board, until some dust got in my eye… <i>ugh</i> how irritating..</p>
                                <p>I’ve gotten too used to it… longing for attention but pushing them away once they’re there. I’m just.. really not good with people. For too long I’ve kept on carrying myself as someone who doesn’t interact with others; someone who doesn’t want to be approached; someone who doesn’t need to be bothered.. It’d be impossible to renew myself and suddenly be someone social.</p>
                                <p>I finally got the broom and began sweeping the floor. Though there wasn't much litter.. the room was dusty. Have the others taking the duty been slacking this week? I wouldn’t be surprised if they were..</p>
                                <p>Continuing to clean from the front—I made way to the middle of the classroom, till another disturbance ensued.</p>
                                <p>A knock on the open door.</p>
                                <p>“Hey, can I ask you something?” his tone was curious and agitated.</p>
                                <p>Although I didn’t reply, I glanced at him—letting him proceed as I continued to sweep around the desks and chairs.</p>
                                <p>“Have you seen Takuma?” he asked.</p>
                                <p>“Don’t know.” I responded with a low voice, not stopping what I was doing as he continued to stare at me.</p>
                                <p>It’s way past class hours… it’s a bit unusual for him to be asking around this late. But most of all, why’s he just standing there?</p>
                                <p>As I remained silent and aloof, I neared the end of the classroom. “I’ve been hearing about you Aihara-san.” he stated, but I didn’t pay any mind. “Seeing you for the first time, you’re really beautiful.”</p>
                                <p>Another flirt.</p>
                                <p>As I kept sweeping and neared the doorway, he was just about to speak when I shut the door on him.</p>
                                <p><i>Finally, a moment of peace.</i></p>
                                <p>But just when I was about to finish—he opened the door and let himself in. “Hey hey, wasn’t that a bit rude?” he laughed. “You’re not just cute—you’re cold, didn’t expect that.”</p>
                                <p>I tidied up the cleaning supplies after I finished and gathered my stuff as he stood there, confused in regards to my actions.</p>
                                <p>“Is this your act to get people interested? If so, I’m interested.” Here I finally got my bag and was about to leave until he blocked the door. “What do you say? I know a lot of places, why not go for a few dates?”</p>
                                <p>At this point, I couldn’t help but glare at him with how he’s been acting. “Who do you think you are?” I remarked before walking around him to leave the classroom, never even looking back for a hundred steps.</p>
                                <p>As I was leaving the school building, the sun had already radiated its golden aura in its set. Now, the buildings had become eerily quiet, void of students, and my footsteps rang louder than ever on my departure.</p>
                                <p>Back when I transferred here, there were a lot of people like him. So many students would leave love letters in my shoe locker. There were those who visited our classroom to excuse me, wanting to talk to me. But after my reputation fell as someone who isn’t actually that interesting, someone who is apparently disrespectful—those scenes died out.</p>
                                <p><i>Thinking about it makes my head hurt…</i></p>
                                <p>I didn't really want to go back yet... so I aimlessly walked around and found myself in the garden. I quickly found a bench which I headed over to and set my bag down. Once sat, I let out a sigh of relief—It wasn't always that I found a spot as calming as this.. The air was calm and tender, washing over me just right.</p>
                                <p>Right… that letter earlier.. I looked through my bag and found it, packed tightly between two of my notebooks. Hesitantly—I opened it again, and sure enough.. I wasn’t delusional, the contents remained the same.</p>
                                <p>Looking at it carefully, there’s two abnormal factors at play.</p>
                                <p>One, It’s appearing in mysterious places even if it doesn’t make sense as to how it got there, especially in my dorm.</p>
                                <p>And two, it apparently came from the future… written by my.. future lover..?</p>
                                <p>It doesn’t make sense, there’s no evidence of it coming from the future.. none except its unusual way of getting to me. The writer said this was the fourth letter, and this is indeed the fourth letter I’ve come across.</p>
                                <p>I really can’t get my head around this…</p>
                                <p>The handwriting is a bit too consistent, I almost thought it was a font. But it undeniably carries features resembling that of human handwriting.</p>
                                <p>What if I’m really being pranked?</p>
                                <p>I don’t want to make a fool out of myself…</p>
                                <p>But still, did I really have to throw out those other letters?</p>
                                <p>I’m.. dying to know what was in them…</p>
                                <p>It's just…</p>
                                <p>Everything doesn’t make sense..</p>
                                <p>How could a letter from the future come here?</p>
                                <p>Is my future lover… here..? Is he going around placing these letters in places I could be? No way.. that’s impossible.</p>
                                <p>It’s really frustrating…</p>
                                <p>This is the first time that I.. can’t understand something.</p>
                                <p>Hopelessly, I returned to my habit of staring afar. It was getting dark, the breeze still refreshing.. and I continued to dote on myself. Until suddenly, I found Hayashi Kousei; my seatmate, standing before the tulips.</p>
                                <p>What was he doing here..? I’m not entirely familiar with him but… he’s different. His voice whenever I rarely heard it was steady, like a metronome clicking in the background. Though I may lack connection, I know his name because I hear about him a lot.. negatively.</p>
                                <p>He’s so annoying, they say.</p>
                                <p>What an unbearable person, they say.</p>
                                <p>I unknowingly kept glancing at his direction for too long, and I saw him sharing eye contact with me. I quickly averted my gaze and worried as I caught the attention of another classmate, I wasn’t in the mood for conversing…</p>
                                <p>How’d he even notice me from that far?</p>
                                <p>…thus I waited.</p>
                                <p>Whenever I notice someone.. they’d always approach me and talk… Perhaps I should just leave and avoid the trouble… Then, as I got buried in my thoughts—I noticed how he was taking too long to get here..</p>
                                <p>So I looked, and he never left his spot.</p>
                                <p>There he remained still, having gone back to minding his own business after that accidental eye contact.. He understood how that stare… meant nothing.</p>
                                <p>How unusual… if only everyone in class was respectful like him. He did interact with me during class but he was never… forceful. Unlike the guys that have been pestering me throughout the school year, especially that guy earlier.</p>
                                <p>In my chase for some place to clarify my thoughts… it seemed as though I only pushed myself to further get lost in them. I was doing nothing but waste time thinking about Hayashi and the letters.</p>
                                <p>The golden sun had fully departed, and the moon had taken its turn.</p>
                                <p>I guess it’s also the dormitory’s turn for me to go to.</p>
                                <p>No matter how much I wanted to stay and observe this strange seatmate of mine, I left the area to get my much needed rest.</p>
